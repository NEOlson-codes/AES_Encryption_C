1) 
If you XOR two binary numbers, A and B, then you XOR the result with B, you'll get A out. This is used in a pretty slick way in AES decryption. In every round, you XOR the state vector bytes by the round key. To go in reverse, you just XOR the encrypted data by the round key. Smart! 

2) 
Writing good comments also takes a lot of time! I probably have more lines of comments in the program than lines of functional code. That's not a bad thing, but something to budget for.

1)
Having a library with different run configurations can be a bit tricky. The AES algorithm does a certain number of "rounds" of scrambling, which is partially dependent on the length of the cipher key. I decided earlier today to extend my library to allow use of 128, 192, or 256 bit keys. This meant that I needed to parameterize some of the operations within my functions to account for the changing key length. This created some difficulty in the 
generate_key_schedule() function. I needed to create a key_schedule[] array, but I wanted it declared inside the function. However, to make the variable exist for the length of the program I needed to make it "static". I ran into the issue that I couldn't have the number of elements in the array be parameterized (variable) and have the array be static. I ended up declaring the array with the number of elements required for AES-256 and then zero-padding the end if AES-192 or AES-128 was going to be used. 

2)
Extern doesn't actually make a variable a global variable. All it does is tell the compiler that the variable is defined (and has its memory allocated) in another file. Kind-of a subtle distinction. 

3)
Even testing fairly simple code can take a lot of time. Almost all the major pieces of code I wrote today didn't work the first time.
